# -DTSC_300_repo
This repository will contain all code from my time in the DTSC 300 course. There may be some code from other projects that I am working on but I will eventually make a new place for the code.

# About Me

Hi my name is Noah and I am currently a Junior at Duquesne University and a Data Science Major. Throughout this semester I will be putting class code and notes into this repository.
